Change Log
==========

2017-10-24: v1.1.0
------------------

* Added notifications. The enabling and badging of the toolbar button weren't visible enough. Also, users couldn't be blamed for hiding the toolbar button. The notification does a better job bringing a attention to a breached site. It's only being shown once for a domain (unless there's a new breach), so it shouldn't be too annoying.


2017-10-24: v1.0.1
------------------

* Update toolbar button when tab begins loading rather than when it's finished. This makes it more noticeable to the user who is waiting for the tab to load. (And there's nothing that relies on the tab being fully loaded.)

* Show the page favicon in the toolbar popup.

* Add more links to haveibeenpwned.com in the popup.

* Fixed icon images.


2017-10-24: v0.0.1
