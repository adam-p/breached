# Breached!

Breached is a browser extension that lets you know when you're visiting a site that has been pwned in the past. You can click the button to find out more about those breaches.

Breached uses [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to learn about breaches. No information about the sites you visit is sent anywhere -- all checks are local.

## Install

**[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/breached/blmhfhlpjoofplegjpalpgnbnnoohpbc)**

**[Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/breached/)**

## TODO

* Domain mapping. Like, `yahoo.ca` should be considered the same as `yahoo.com` when looking for breaches.
