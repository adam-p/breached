==========

2017-10-24: v1.0.1
------------------

* Update toolbar button when tab begins loading rather than when it's finished. This makes it more noticeable to the user who is waiting for the tab to load. (And there's nothing that relies on the tab being fully loaded.)

* Show the page favicon in the toolbar popup.

* Add more links to haveibeenpwned.com in the popup.

* Fixed icon images.


2017-10-24: v0.0.1
