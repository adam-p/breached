# Privacy Policy

The _Breached_ browser extension strictly does one thing: Check if a newly opened website domain is in the [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) (HIBP) breach database and, if it is, gives the user some info about the breach. Not one thing else.

This means that:
- It collects no user or usage data.
- It does not read or modify any part of any site besides the domain part of the URL.
- It does not send the domain to HIBP. The only request it makes is to download a list of breaches from HIBP.
